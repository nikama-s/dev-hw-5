Hi! I'm Veronika Maslo, I'm 17 and am currently studying programming at KPI.

My coding experience in school was limited to "hello world", written in python, but then I entered KPI and dev school and started learning. I really like it here :purple_heart: The best thing in the university is people. I have the best groupmates and mentors (idk how to say kurators correctly)

I don't know what to tell about myself, so let me tell a bit about my cat
